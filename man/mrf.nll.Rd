\title{Calculate MRF negative log-likelihood}
\usage{
mrf.nll(par, crf, instances, infer.method = infer.chain, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{par}{The parameter vector of CRF}

\item{crf}{The CRF}

\item{instances}{The training data matrix of MRF model}

\item{infer.method}{The inference method used to compute the likelihood}

\item{...}{Other parameters need by the inference method}
}
\value{
This function will return the value of MRF negative log-likilihood.
}
\description{
Calculate the negative log-likelihood of MRF model
}
\details{
This function calculates the negative log-likelihood of MRF model as well as 
the gradient. This function is intended to be called by optimization algorithm
in training process. Before calling this function, the MRF sufficient 
statistics must be calculated and stored in object \code{par.stat} of CRF.

In the training data matrix \code{instances}, each row is an instance and 
each column corresponds a node in CRF.
